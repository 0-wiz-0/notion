Ion Xinerama module (based on the mod_xrandr skeleton)
by Thomas Themel <themel0r@wanabehacket.com>

INTRODUCTION

This module gives ion3 back its Xinerama support that was killed on 20070117.

INSTALLATION

        1. Edit Makefile to ensure TOPDIR points to your top-level ion source
           directory with a system.mk that matches the version of ion installed
           on your system.

        2. Run make.

        3. Either run (as root)
                # make install
           or (as yourself),
                $ mkdir -p ~/.ion3/lib
                $ cp .libs/mod_xinerama.* ~/.ion3/lib
        4. Add dopath("mod_xinerama") to ~/.ion3/cfg_ion.lua. 
        5. (Re)start Ion.
		

LIMITATIONS

This does not contain the Sun Xinerama support that was in the original ion3 because
I don't have a machine running Solaris ready. Adding it should be rather trivial with
access to the original ion code and a Solaris machine.
