BUILDING AND INSTALLING

1. Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

    * GNU make
    * Lua 5.0.1 (see <http://www.lua.org/>). 
    
   Lua 5.0 has a stack management bug that manifests in Ion, resulting in
   broken .lc files and occasionally missing functions. Please do not use it.

2. a) Run ./configure; see README.autoconf for details, especially if
      you are using the Debian Lua packages.

      (This method does not work for the moment.)

   b) Alternatively, edit system.mk to suit your system. If the autoconf
      script failed for some reason and you are falling back to this choice
      because of that, remove system-ac.mk. Most GNU/Linux users should
      need very little modifications to system.mk.

3. If you want to build some extra modules now or do not want to build
   some of the standard modules, edit modulelist.mk.
   
4. Run 'make'. Note that 'make' here refers to GNU make which is usually
   named 'gmake' on systems with some other implementation of make as 
   default.
   
5. Run 'make install', as root if you set $PREFIX in system.mk to a 
   directory that requires those privileges.
   
   YOU SHOULD NOT SKIP THIS STEP unless you know what you are doing. Ion
   will refuse to start if it can not find all the necessary uncorrupt
   configuration files either in $PREFIX/etc/ion/ or in ~/.ion2/.

6. How to best set up 'startx' or whatever to start Ion instead of your
   current window manager depends on your system's setup. A good guess
   is creating or modifying an executable shell script .xsession in your
   home directory to start Ion. This should usually (but not always) work
   if you're using some X display/login manager. If ~/.xsession does not 
   help and you're not using a display manager, modifying ~/.xinitrc or 
   creating one based on your system's xinitrc (wherever that may be; 
   use locate) may be what you need to do.


Please see the file RELNOTES for additional release-specific installation
and configuration notes.


SOME OPTIONAL INSTALLATION STEPS

1. The scripts 'ion-edit' and 'ion-view' in $SHAREDIR and bound to the F5
   and F6 keys expect the program 'run-mailcap' to be found. This program
   opens a viewer/editor for a file based on its MIME type. Unless you are
   using Debian, most likely you don't have it, but any other similar 
   program (or just plain old text editor) will do as well - just modify the
   scripts. Of course, if you don't want to use the feature at this time or 
   never, you may simply skip this step. If you want to use run-mailcap, it
   can be found from the following address, as a source tarball as well:
   
   <http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/mime-support.html>

2. Ion supports caching known man-pages in a file for faster man-page
   completion in the F1 man page query. To enable this feature, you must
   periodically run a cronjob to build this list. To create a system-wide
   man page cache, run 'crontab -e' (might vary depending on platform) as
   root and enter a line such as follows:

15 05 * * * $SHAREDIR/ion-completeman -mksyscache

   Replace $SHAREDIR with the setting from system.mk (or system-ac.mk if you
   used autoconf). This example runs daily at 05:15, but you may modify the 
   run times to your needs; see the crontab manual. 
   
   If you can't or do not want to build a system-wide man page cache, run
   'crontab -e' as your normal user and replace '-mksyscache' with
   '-mkusercache' above. The cache file will be ~/.ion3/mancache.
   
   It may also be useful to run ion-completeman with the suitable
   '-mk*cache' argument once manually to build the initial cache.
   
   If the MANPATH environment variable is not set on your system and it
    does not have the 'manpath' command (or it does not print anything 
   sensible), you may also want to set the ION_MC_MANPATH environment
   variable to the list of paths where the system stores manual pages.
