BUILDING AND INSTALLING

1. Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

    * GNU make
    * Libtool and libltdl, version 1.4.0 or newer
    * Lua 5.0.1 (see <http://www.lua.org/>)

2. Edit system.mk to suit your system. If heavy modifications are required,
   you might want to save the file somewhere for future use. (Most GNU/Linux
   users should need very little of any modifications.) 
   If you want to build some extra modules now or do not want to build
   some of the standard modules, edit modulelist.mk.
   
3. Run 'make'. Note that 'make' here refers to GNU make which is usually
   named 'gmake' on systems with some other implementation of make as 
   default.
   
4. Run 'make install', as root if you set $PREFIX in system.mk to a directory
   that requires those privileges.
   
   YOU SHOULD NOT SKIP THIS STEP unless you know what you are doing. Ion
   will refuse to start if it can not find all the necessary uncorrupt
   configuration files either in $PREFIX/etc/ion/ or in ~/.ion2/.

5. How to best set up 'startx' or whatever to start Ion instead of your
   current window manager depends on your system's setup. A good guess
   is creating or modifying an executable shell script .xsession in your
   home directory to start Ion. This should also work if you're using some
   X display/login manager (unless the person who configured it is totally
   brain damaged and has not set it up to allow selecting .xsession). 
   If ~/.xsession does not help and you're not using a display manager, 
   modifying ~/.xinitrc or creating one based on your system's xinitrc
   (wherever that may be; use locate) may be what you need to do.

6. The scripts 'ion-edit' and 'ion-view' in $SHAREDIR and bound to the
   F5 and F6 keys expect the program 'run-mailcap' to be found. This 
   program opens a viewer/editor for a file based on its MIME type. 
   Unless you are using Debian, most likely you don't have it, but any
   other similar program (or just plain old text editor) will do as
   well - just modify the scripts. Of course, if you don't want to use
   the feature at this time or never, you may simply skip this step. 
   If you want to use run-mailcap, it can be found from the address
   <http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/mime-support.html>
   as tarball as well.
