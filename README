BUILDING AND INSTALLING

1. Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

    * GNU make
    * Properly preconfigured GNU libtool and libltdl3. Some earlier
      versions may work in some cases, but version 1.4.3 or newer is
      _highly_ recommended.
    * Lua 5.0 (see <http://www.lua.org/>)

2. Edit system.mk to suit your system. If heavy modifications are required,
   you might want to save the file somewhere for future use. (Most GNU/Linux
   users should need very little of any modifications.)
   
3. Run 'make depend && make'. Note that 'make' here refers to GNU make which
   is usually named 'gmake' on systems with some other implementation of
   make as default.
   
4. Run 'make install', as root if you set $PREFIX in system.mk to a directory
   that requires those privileges.
   
5. If you did not install Ion so that $PREFIX/bin is on $PATH, you should add
   it there. Otherwise Ion can not find the various ion-* helper scripts.
    
   YOU SHOULD NOT SKIP THIS LAST STEP unless you know what you are doing.
   Ion will refuse to start if it can not find all the necessary uncorrupt
   configuration files either in $PREFIX/etc/ion-devel/ or in ~/.ion-devel/.


ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION

The scripts 'ion-edit' and 'ion-view' (F5 and F6 keys) expect the
program 'run-mailcap' to be found. This program opens a viewer/editor
for a file based on its mime-type. Most likely you don't have it, but
any other similar program (or just plain old text editor) will do as
well - just modify the scripts. Unless you don't want to use them,
of course. If you want to use run-mailcap, it can be found at
<http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/mime-support.html>
(as .tar.gz as well).

For help on modifying Ion's configuration files, read the documentation
at <http://iki.fi/tuomov/ion/#docs>. The Ion home page and the
wikiwiki may provide other usefull links.
