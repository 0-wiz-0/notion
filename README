BUILDING AND INSTALLING

1. Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

    * GNU make
    * Libtool and libltdl. Version 1.4.3 or newer is required; ancient
      1.3.x will not work. Users of many of the *BSD:s will have to
      manually install a recent libtool because even though a lot of apps
      that use libltdl require 1.4.3 even more recent than libtool-1.4.3
      releases of those OSes still fail to include but an _ancient_ 1.3.x
      libtool that simply _will_ _not_ _work_.
    * Lua 5.0 (see <http://www.lua.org/>)

2. Edit system.mk to suit your system. If heavy modifications are required,
   you might want to save the file somewhere for future use. (Most GNU/Linux
   users should need very little of any modifications.)
   
3. Run 'make'. Note that 'make' here refers to GNU make which is usually
   named 'gmake' on systems with some other implementation of make as 
   default.
   
4. Run 'make install', as root if you set $PREFIX in system.mk to a directory
   that requires those privileges.
   
   YOU SHOULD NOT SKIP THIS STEP unless you know what you are doing. Ion
   will refuse to start if it can not find all the necessary uncorrupt
   configuration files either in $PREFIX/etc/ion-devel/ or in ~/.ion-devel/.

5. The scripts 'ion-edit' and 'ion-view' in $SHAREDIR and bound to the
   F5 and F6 keys expect the program 'run-mailcap' to be found. This 
   program opens a viewer/editor for a file based on its MIME type. 
   Unless you are using Debian, most likely you don't have it, but any
   other similar program (or just plain old text editor) will do as
   well - just modify the scripts. Of course, if you don't want to use
   the feature at this time or never, you may simply skip this step. 
   If you want to use run-mailcap, it can be found from the address
   <http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/mime-support.html>
   as tarball as well.
