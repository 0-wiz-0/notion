This is a simple "remote control" module for Ion. To build it, edit
IONDIR in system.mk to point to Ion2 top-level source tarball 
top-level directly. Then run 'make' and 'make install'.

The 'mod_ionflux' module must be loaded before starting any shells
where the 'ionflux' program is to be used as the unix domain socket
to use is passed in the IONFLUX_SOCKET environment variable.
