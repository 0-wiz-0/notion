This is a simple "remote control" module for Ion. To build it, edit
IONDIR in system.mk to point to Ion2 top-level source tarball 
top-level directly. Then run 'make' and 'make install'.

The 'mod_notionflux' module must be loaded before starting any shells
where the 'notionflux' program is to be used as the unix domain socket
to use is passed in the NOTIONFLUX_SOCKET environment variable.
