INTRODUCTION

	This module provides a dock for the ion-devel window manager. It is
	designed to work with ion-devel-20031211.

	Features:
	- supports most dockapps
	- configurable layout
	- configurable dockapp order
	- supports shaped dockapps
	- uses ion-devel's drawing engine

	The following dockapps are believed to work:

	asbutton	asclock -d	ascpu -withdrawn
	asmem -withdrawn		asmon

	wmail		wmcpuload	wmfire		wminet
	wmMatrix	wmmemmon	wmmsg		wmnd
	wmnet -w	wmnetload	wmsmixer -w	wmsysmon
	wmtop		wmusic		wmupmon

	The following dockapps are known to have problems:

	- gkrellm2 can have the wrong shape if it is started after the dock
	  module is loaded. See KNOWN BUGS below.

	- wmxmms needs a winprop{...}. See the example dock.lua. ion-devel
	  complains: Client window "wmxmms" has broken transient_for hint.
	  ("Extended WM hints" multi-parent brain damage?).

	If your favourite dockapp does not work then please inform the author.

DEPENDENCIES

	ion-devel-20031211
	ion-devel-dock can also use the Shape extension if it is present on the
	server.

INSTALLATION

	1. Edit Makefile to ensure TOPDIR points to your top-level ion-devel
	source directory with a system.mk that matches the version of
	ion-devel installed on your system.

	2. Run make.

	3. Either run (as root)
		# make install
	or (as yourself),
		$ mkdir -p ~/.ion-devel/lib
		$ cp dock.la dock.lo .libs/dock.so ~/.ion2/lib

	4. Copy the configuration files to your ~/.ion2
	directory:
		$ cp dock.lua dock-draw.lua ~/.ion2 
	Edit dock.lua to suit your preferences.

	5. Add load_module("dock") to ~/.ion2/ion.lua.

	6. Add include("dock-draw.lua") near the end of ~/.ion2/draw.lua,
	before gr_refresh().

	7. (Re)start ion-devel.

CONFIGURATION

	See the comments in dock.lua dock-draw.lua.

KNOWN BUGS

	Not all dockapps dock. This is because dockapps use a variety of
	methods to signal that they are dockapps and ion-devel-dock doesn't
	yet recognise all of them. If your favourite dockapp does not work
	then please inform the author (email address at top of file).

	The order of dockapps in the dock is not maintained over a restart.

	gkrellm2 can have the wrong shape if it is started after
	ion-devel-dock.

	ion-devel-dock can break unpredictably with non-sensible configuration
	parameters.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

	If you would like to help improve ion-devel-dock then the following
	notes might be useful.

	You should use folding in your editor when you edit/view the source
	code. The code follows ion's coding standards, but there are many more
	folds. VIM and Emacs both support folding.

	Dockapps use a variety of methods to signal to the window manager that
	they are a dockapp. ion-devel automatically detects some (see
	manage_clientwin() in ioncore/clientwin.c), and ion-devel-dock
	detects some others (see dock_clientwin_is_dockapp() in dock.c).
	Adding more dockapp types will require editing these functions and
	possibly writing type-specific management code.

	The dock should really implement region_save_to_file()/region_load()
	to maintain state over a restart and session management. However, over
	restart a new dock will also be created by dock.lua, meaning that
	there will be multiple docks on the same screen. The solution is
	probably to automatically create docks as they are required, with
	dock.lua specifying the default configuration of new docks but not
	actually creating any docks.

	As far as I can tell the gkrellm2 problem is a race condition and the
	sequence of events is as follows:
	1. gkrellm2 starts and gets added to the dock with is initial geom.
	2. gkrellm2 grows as it loads plugins.
	3. ion-devel-dock allocates more space to gkrellm2 and requests
	gkrellm2's new shape, but gkrellm2 reports its old shape.
	4. Further requests to gkrellm2 return is new (actual) shape, but by
	now it's too late...
	Any assistance in fixing this bug would be much appreciated.
