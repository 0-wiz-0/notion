.SH BASIC CONCEPTS

This section is an overview of the types objects that appear on an X
display managed by Ion and their relationships in a standard setup.
This information is necessary to understand the operations of different
key bindings. For a more detailed explanation, needed for writing
custom bindings configuration files, see the additional documentation
available from the Ion Web page.

The top-level objects that matter are screens and they correspond to
physical screens. Screens contain workspaces and client windows put in
full screen mode. Only one of these "multiplexed" objects can be viewed
at a time. 

Two types of workspaces currently supported; tiled (traditional Ion-style) 
and floating (pwm-style). Workspaces are not visible objects but rather 
collections of frames. Frames are the objects with decorations such as 
tabs and borders and there are two types of these corresponding to the
diffent types of workspaces.

Frames contain (multiplex) client windows, to each of which corresponds a
tab in the frame's decoration. Only one client window (or other object) 
can be shown at a time in each frame. (In a traditional window manager
each frame may contain exactly one client window.)

"Messages" are boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames or screens.
These are used to display important information, such as error messages.

"Queries" are also boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames or screens 
and are used to ask the user for textual input. Most queries support 
tab-completion.


.SH KEYS

These are the default keybindings.
.B Mod1
depends on your system. On PC:s with XFree86 it is probably bound to the left
alt key (\fBAlt_L\fP).
On Suns it is usually bound to the diamond keys (\fBMeta_L\fP, \fBMeta_R\fP). Use
\fIxmodmap(1x)\fP to find out.

.SS F-keys

.TP

Show manual page (query, uses ion-man). Tab-completion can be enabled by
specifying a list of directories in the variable query_man_path.

.SH POINTING DEVICE BUTTONS

The bindings for the two types of frames are again different because not
all legacy/floating frame actions are available on tiled frames and thus
those buttons have been mapped to other actions.

.TP
.B Button1 (left) on border
