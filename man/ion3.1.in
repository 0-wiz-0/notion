.TP
.B \-cfgfile configfile
Configuration file to use instead of default
.TP
.B \-moduledir dir
Directory to search for module
.TP
.B \-confdir dir

.TP
.B \-oneroot
On X servers with multiple (traditional non-Xinerama) screens, manage only
default screen (root window), not all, as given by the -display option or
in the DISPLAY environment variable.
.TP
.B \-sessionname session_name
Set session name. This option affects where workspace and other save files are
put (~/.ion3/session_name if option set).
.TP
.B \-xinerama 0|1

enable/disable (1/0) the use of it. The default is to use Xinerama
screen information.

.SH BASIC CONCEPTS

This section is an overview of the types objects that appear on an X
display managed by Ion and their relationships in a standard setup.
This information is necessary to understand the operations of different
key bindings. For a more detailed explanation, needed for writing
custom bindings configuration files, see the additional documentation
available from the Ion Web page.

The top-level objects that matter are screens and they correspond to
physical screens. Screens contain workspaces and client windows put in
full screen mode. Only one of these "multiplexed" objects can be viewed
at a time. 

Two types of workspaces are currently supported; tiled (traditional Ion-style) 
and floating (PWM-style). Workspaces are not visible objects but rather 
collections of frames. Frames are the objects with decorations such as 
tabs and borders and there are two types of these corresponding to the
different types of workspaces.

Frames contain (multiplex) client windows, to each of which corresponds a
tab in the frame's decoration. Only one client window (or other object) 
can be shown at a time in each frame. (In a traditional window manager
each frame may contain exactly one client window.)

"Queries" are boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames or screens 
and are used to ask the user for textual input. Most queries support 
tab-completion.


.SH BINDINGS

These are the default key and pointer bindings.
.B Mod1
depends on your system. On PC:s with XFree86 it is probably bound to the left
Alt key (\fBAlt_L\fP).
On Suns it is usually bound to the diamond keys (\fBMeta_L\fP, \fBMeta_R\fP). 
Use \fIxmodmap(1x)\fP to find out.

The string in square brackets after a binding group heading below indicates
the module that whose configuration file defines these bindings.
